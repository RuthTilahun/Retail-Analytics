## How I Prepared the Data

Data used: [Superstore dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final?resource=download)

9) Keep your analysis reproducible

Put every final query in sql/02_queries.sql (well-commented).

If you transformed data in SQL, add sql/01_schema.sql or sql/transformations.sql.

If you created extracts for Tableau, note the source table/view names in the README.

Include small sample CSVs in data/ (not the whole dataset).

10) Write your README as you go (don’t wait to the end)

Stick to your Phase 1 outline and fill in:

Problem → Approach → Results (CEO/CMO)

Screenshots for 2–3 key visuals

“How to reproduce” (exact commands to run SQL)

Assumptions, limitations, and next steps

Git commands
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: scaffold project structure"
git push
